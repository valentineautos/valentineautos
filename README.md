Hi, Iâ€™m Andy Valentine from www.youtube.com/@GarageTinkering and www.youtube.com/@ValentineAutos

I create automotive ESP32 tinker projects, and this is where I will store and update the repos that power those projects.
The idea is to expand it to a large open source project, but we'll get there a bit at a time.
